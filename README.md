# About

These are some chrome extensions that i've found missing on the market.

# How to

This aren't listed in chrome market, it needs to pay some $, but i only have one extension currently, so it's just not worth doing.
So you'll need to install it manually, it's very easy.

1. Clone repo into some of your folders: `git clone https://github.com/B1Z0N/BronzeXT`
2. Go to your extensions(chrome://extensions/) page and click `Developer mode` in the top right corner
3. Click `Load unpacked` in top left corner and supply a path to the folder of extension that you need(not to the repo's folder)

And you're done. But during update in repo you'll need to got to [extensions page](chrome://extensions/) again and click reload button on your extension.
